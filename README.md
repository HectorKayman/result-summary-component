## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

For this challenge, I followed Kevin Powells tutorial, where he shows how he approaches a project from start to finish, he explains the 'how?' and 'why' of things in great details. His tutorial is perfect for this, as I wanted to know the thought process of an experienced frontend developer.

The CSS code showcases a comprehensive set of variables for defining colors, fonts, and other design elements, ensuring consistency and ease of maintenance.

In short, this project and Kevin's tutorial on it, taught me the importance of organized and scalable code, correct responsive design principles, and semantic HTML for creating functional and visually appealing web components.

I also learned the use of custom data properties to modify CSS, as shown below:

```css
.grid-flow[data-spacing="large"] {
  gap: 2rem;
}
```

### Continued development

I will be looking into completing the bonus challenge, in the near future, i.e., using the local JSON data to dynamically populate the content.

And, I will be trying to use the all the things I learned, such as, different versions of global variables, locally scoped variables, custom data propeties, etc. in my future projects
